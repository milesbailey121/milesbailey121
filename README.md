Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a bioinformatician with a Master of Research in Big Data Biology and a strong focus on image-based research. I specialise in analysing high-resolution brightfield and fluorescence imaging data using Python and R for tissue segmentation, biomarker quantification, and spatial analysis.

I’ve developed custom image analysis pipelines that process spatial and expression data across over 1.2 million cells, leveraging Python and R. My work aims bridge wet-lab and computational teams, helping translate technical outputs into meaningful biological insights. I’m also passionate about open science, reproducibility, and mentoring peers in computational methods.

## Research Projects
- **[Masters Thesis: Breast Tissue Cohort Analysis](https://github.com/milesbailey121/MRes-Dissertation)**:  
 
  Investigated protein expression and spatial heterogeneity in breast cancer tissues using multiplex IHC imaging and deep learning. Developed Python CLI tools and R scripts for image correction, cell segmentation, and spatial profiling.
- **[Cellpose Quantification](https://github.com/milesbailey121/cellpose-quantification)**:  
  A Python CLI tool I developed and was adopted by my former lab to quantify segmeneted images, enabling analyses that were previously not possible.

- **[Variant calling Nextflow Pipeline](https://github.com/milesbailey121/variant-calling-workflow)**:
  A Nextflow automated pipeline for variant calling (FASTQ to VCF) incorporating QC, alignment with implemented multi-platform deployment via Conda, Docker, and AWS Batch using Nextflow configuration profiles (BWA), variant calling (GATK), and annotation

## Personal Projects
- **[Boid Simulator](https://github.com/milesbailey121/boid-simulator)**:
  A Python-based simulation of flocking behavior using vector maths and collision detection, designed to improve object-oriented programming and animation skills.
- **[Sorting Visualizer in C++](https://github.com/milesbailey121/sorting-visualiser)**:  
  A C++ visualisation of classic sorting algorithms, built with SFML to animate the sorting process in real time.

## What I'm Working on?  
- Supporting cell segmentation and centrosome analysis for ongoing research papers
- Workflow management tools like **Nextflow** to automate analysis
